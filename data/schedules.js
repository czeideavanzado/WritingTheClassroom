Poetic works are used to shed light on philosophical problems. It also discusses modern and contemporary poets whose works are inclined toward philosophy.

              "In 1979, “Rapper’s Delight” by The Sugarhill Gang became the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit. Thirty-nine years later, rapper Kendrick Lamar’s album DAMN. won the Pulitzer Prize—the first non-classical, non-jazz record to receive this distinction. The genre emerged out of inner-city, African-American neighborhoods, but its origins are undeniably rooted in poetry. So how—and most importantly, why—did this form of literature, usually associated with highbrow society, become the preferred medium for historically un- and under-educated, marginalized communities to tell their story? What can we glean from the accessibility of verse that could help us enrich and empower our own students, especially those who find themselves academically deficient and/or disenfranchised? This workshop will include a brief background in the origins of “poems set to a beat” and spoken word poetry, with an emphasis on seminal works that have been catalysts for social change. Then we will share practical classroom activities with the objective of piquing students’ interest in poetry (with popular rap music and spoken word as an entrée), honing the skillset required in the appreciation and creation of poetry, and encouraging self-expression."

Una, pagbabasa at talakayan ng dalawang maikling kuwento ni Leoncio P. Deriada na “The Week of the Whales” at “Ang Kamatayon sang Isa ka Kalye” concentrating on the setting as fictional element at kung paano nahuhubog ang plot at ang mga karakter sa dalawang kuwento. Second, a workshop where participants will craft an idea of a short story they are going to write where setting is a strong environmental force. Hindi lamang tungkol sa pagsusulat ng katha ang sesyon na ito kundi tungkol din sa pagtuturo kung paano magbasa at magsulat ng short story."

The “self” that nonfiction writers create through various platforms or media is inevitably gendered and “sexed.”  As teachers, we need to ask how we can use our CNF class towards a critical examination and revaluation of hegemonic and heteronormative practices that have plagued the world for so long. How can we fuse the development or sharpening of creative writing and critical thinking skills with the ethics of life writing?  How can we use creative writing as a methodological tool and/or approach to broaden our students’ understanding of sex, gender, and sexuality?  Using sample texts by LGBTQIA and women writers, this module will teach students/teachers how to “queer” their class and how to design tasks that will deepen students’ consciousness of their subject-position as gendered/sexual beings."

Some of the reasons for this is that it provides a chance to reflect on an aspect of one’s life, craft it into a powerful and inspiring narrative, and articulate its value for growth. This lecture/workshop on memoir writing is divided into two parts. The first part will consider the more effective ways of writing a memoir by looking at the philosophy behind its writing, the concept of time and narrative framing, and the “bigger idea” behind a memoir. This will largely be done through the close reading of excerpts from published creative nonfiction books. In the second part of the workshop, participants will be asked to identify their own stories, outline their narratives, and write a one-page essay that integrate the lessons from the first part. The workshop will conclude with a discussion synthesizing how the participants’ individual writings may be improved for completion and future publishing plans."

One doesn’t need a music degree to participate in this master class; they only need to be interested in music –– in listening to it and in talking about it. Our approach to discussing the language of song will explore every beat, every clearing of the throat, every rise and fall, every step of a melismatic passage, every snap of the finger –– every little thing that either sharpens the present and persistent grit in the song, or illuminates the polished edges of the text’s every measure. All toward furthering the discussion to how the song potentially speaks to us, about us, and of course, fostering in one’s art class the practice of beginning a worthwhile discussion about our humanity by speaking ordinarily about something."

              "Moving beyond being a mere theoretical concept, Intertextuality has become a dominant characteristic in the teaching and learning of 21st Century Literature due to its ability to tap on 21st century skills (i.e. critical thinking, digital literacy and collaboration) and themes (globalization, environmental literacy, etc.) due to its concentration on the networking of and interrelationships between literary texts. To intertext ‘culture’ as a text or as supplementary text to the understanding of literary works is this master class’s modest attempt to expand and update the pedagogical grounds of 21st century literature. This master class will discuss ways on how cultural motifs and phenomenon – such as present-day trends on Filipino migration and cosmopolitanism in Southeast Asia - intertext with key Philippine and World Literature texts in the 21st century."

              "The spatial turn, introduced by human geographer Edward Soja during the mid-nineties, calls for greater focus that must be accorded to the category of space. In recent years, discussions of space in literary and cultural studies revolved around concepts such as topology, topography, and geography, to name a few. In this lecture, I attempt to trace the fundamental dynamics of spatiality and how such concepts unpack literary and cultural texts for further scrutiny. I posit that spatial approaches introduce additional layers when examining literature and culture. How are real and imagines spaces read in and through literature and culture? What supplementary dimensions and realms are opened when spatiality is introduced in the equation of unloading texts, textualities, and contexts? By outlining a rough sketch of the contours of spatial movements within specific junctures in history, I will give examples on how to operationalize spatial methodologies in chosen literary and cultural texts. Ultimately, through its interdisciplinarity, we can locate the coordinates of spatiality in literature and culture, providing a cartographic lens that broadens our field."

              "The Covid19 pandemic wrought and continues to write into everyone’s lives a historical paradigm shift in our work as educators and communicators. Before the pandemic, we articulated our belief that in the Anthropocene, educators must face the challenge of creating and exploring new multidisciplinary spaces for dialogue and collaboration among them, and between them and the learners under their instruction in the so-called “specialized” disciplines of human knowledge. Now, we believe even more urgently that in order to confront the unprecedented and unimaginable changes taking place in the natural environment, educators need to put in place in their praxis a radical shift from the rigid exclusivity or “purity” of specialized academic disciplines, to the supple, and creative inclusivity of collaborative “fields of learning”. Such fields of learning would nurture agile scholarship with the ability to uncover and discover layers of complex entanglements, intersections, and conjunctions between Literature and the Humanities, Cultural Anthropology and the Social Sciences, Biology and the Sciences. This expansive interconnected complexity also breaks the academic walls which give the illusion that the classroom is separate from actual communities in threatened farming and fishing villages in the country, or that human thought and behavior take place in bounded socio-cultural spaces that stand apart from nature. Donna Haraway calls this ecosystemic cross-pollination and collaboration “sympoeisis” — both a way of staying with the trouble, of making each other, and looking for creative solutions to problems that threaten life on our planet."
